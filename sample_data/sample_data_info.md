# **Sample Data Folder** üìÇ

We've included two sample images to use as input for **`infer-subc`**. The images and outputs are from experiments featured in this preprint [Neurons and astrocytes have distinct organelle signatures and responses to stress](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.30.621066v1). In this paper infer-subc was used to analyze differences between neurons and astrocytes at baseline and in response to stress.

To access and use the sample data in the notebooks or Napari,
follow the instructions below:

**1.** Clone the **infer-subc** repository

**2.** Follow the steps in [notebook 1.0_image_setup](/notebooks/part_1_segmentation_workflows/1.0_image_setup.ipynb) to download and correctly store the raw images in the [**sample_data**](../sample_data/) folder.

**3.** Use workflow 1.1 to segment the masks for each example image. This can be done in the notebooks or Napari.

- For the example **neuron** use workflow [1.1a](/notebooks/part_1_segmentation_workflows/1.1a_infer_masks_from-composite_single_cell.ipynb)
- For the example **astrocyte** use workflow [1.1b](/notebooks/part_1_segmentation_workflows/1.1b_infer_masks_from-composite_multiple-cells.ipynb)

**4.** Then run workflows 1.2-1.7 twice (once per cell type).

- In the notebooks, you can switch between cell types by setting the `sample_data_type` variable equal to **"neuron"** or **"astrocyte"**.

**5.** Carry out quantification of the sample neuron and astrocyte in part 2 using the notebooks.

- ***Required***: Run the the [full quantification pipeline](/notebooks/part_2_quantification/full_quantification_pipeline.ipynb) to quantify the morpholgy, interaction and distributions of each organelle and summarize the data per cell

- ***Optional***: You can use notebook 2.1-2.6 to understand the quantification process that is carried out in the [full quantification pipeline](/notebooks/part_2_quantification/full_quantification_pipeline.ipynb)

##### You may also use the sample data via the [organelle-segmenter-plugin](https://github.com/ndcn/organelle-segmenter-plugin) in Napari. For instructions, look under the Option A section in the **[ReadMe](/README.md)**. 



## Contents of Sample Data Folder üóÇÔ∏è
###### This section details the expected contents of the sample data folder after the infer-subc notebooks and/or Napari plugin are run as described above. A link to the expected output is included when applicable. Of note, these links are just a reference to the expected outocome if needed. There is no need to download them because ,the notebooks in part 1 and part 2 will create them as intended. If you wish to download the original files, this can be done simply by clicking the links.

- #### quant
    ###### This folder stores the quantification output from notebooks **2.5**, **2.6** and **full_quantification_pipeline**. The sample data batches the quantification of the astrocyte and neuron together to display functionality. Links are in reference to the original datasets where instead the observations were batched by cell type. Please note that **VD-0505** and **C2-121** are the names of the experimental replicates of the example **astrocyte** and the **neuron** respecitively. Additionally, in future versions of infer-subc the term **contacts** will be replaced by **interactions**.
