    "## 1. GOAL SETTING ✍\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we make explicit what we are trying to accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GOAL:  Infer sub-cellular components in order to understand interactome \n",
    "To measure shape, position, size, and interaction of eight organelles/cellular components (Nuclei (NU), Lysosomes (LS),Mitochondria (MT), Golgi (GL), Peroxisomes (PO), Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), Lipid Droplet (LD), and SOMA) during differentiation of iPSCs, in order to understand the Interactome / Spatiotemporal coordination.\n",

    "The second step is to get the data.  Capturing the data could be either from running the experiment, or mining a database.   Implicitly we need to also capture all the assumptions and methodologies, or _meta-data_.\n",

    "> iPSC lines prepared and visualized on Zeiss Microscopes. 32 channel multispectral z-stack images will be collected.  Linear Unmixing in  ZEN Blue software with target emission spectra yields 8 channel z-stack image outputs.  Channels correspond to: Nuclei (NU), Lysosomes (LS),Mitochondria (MT), Golgi (GL), Peroxisomes (PO), Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), Lipid Droplet (LD), and a “residual” signal.\n",

    "### DATA: linearly un-mixed flourescence images in .czi files\n",
    "\n",
    "The bulk of the code in this repo is to solve this step:  processing the \"raw\" (e.g., linear unmixed) data to infer the locations of sub-cellular oranelles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. IMAGE PROCESSING  ⚙️🩻🔬\n",
    "### INFERENCE OF SUB-CELLULAR OBJECTS\n",
    "The imported images have already been pre-processed to transform the 32 channel spectral measuremnts into \"linearly unmixed\" images which estimate independently labeled sub-cellular components.  These 7 channels (plus a residual \"non-linear\" signal) will be used to infer the shapes and extents of these sub-cellular components.   \n",
    "The images will be processed in 3D (x,y,z) using all z-slices from the original image.\n",
    "We will perform computational image analysis on the pictures to _segment_ (or _binarize_) the components of interest for measurement.  In other procedures we can used these labels as \"ground truth\" labels to train machine learning models to automatically perform the inference of these objects.\n",
    "Pseudo-independent processing of the imported multi-channel image to acheive each of the 9 objecives stated above.  i.e. infering: NUCLEI, SOMA, CYTOSOL, LYSOSOME, MITOCHONDRIA, GOLGI COMPLEX, PEROZISOMES, ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM, and LIPID BODIES\n",

    "### NOTE: PIPELINE TOOL AND DESIGN CHOICES?\n",
    "We want to leverage the Allen Cell & Structure Segmenter.  It has been wrapped as a [napari-plugin](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-allencell-segmenter) but for the workflow we are creating here, we will want to call the `aicssegmentation` [package](https://github.com/AllenCell/aics-segmentation) directly.\n",

    "### ​The Allen Cell & Structure Segmenter \n",
    "​The Allen Cell & Structure Segmenter is a Python-based open source toolkit developed at the Allen Institute for Cell Science for 3D segmentation of intracellular structures in fluorescence microscope images. This toolkit brings together classic image segmentation and iterative deep learning workflows first to generate initial high-quality 3D intracellular structure segmentations and then to easily curate these results to generate the ground truths for building robust and accurate deep learning models. The toolkit takes advantage of the high replicate 3D live cell image data collected at the Allen Institute for Cell Science of over 30 endogenous fluorescently tagged human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines. Each cell line represents a different intracellular structure with one or more distinct localization patterns within undifferentiated hiPS cells and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.\n",
